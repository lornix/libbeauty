Compilation and Installation instructions
-----------------------------------------
Authors: Arun Prakash Jana (engineerarun@gmail.com)

Platform: Tested on Ubuntu 13.04
Compiler: gcc or clang

Prerequisites:
-------------
autoconf
libtool
llvm-dev
libclang-dev
llvm Git development branch source code - http://llvm.org/git/llvm.git

Steps to install libbeauty:
--------------------------

1. Check-out llvm source from Git
 $ git clone http://llvm.org/git/llvm.git

2. cd to the llvm directory.

3. Compile the llvm library as a shared library
 $ ./configure --enable-shared
 $ make

4. Install methods:
a) make install
b) Copy the shared library Debug+Asserts/lib/libLLVM-3.5svn.so to
 /usr/lib/libLLVM-3.5svn.so (32-bit system)
 /usr/lib64/libLLVM-3.5svn.so (64-bit system)

5. Download the libbeauty source:
Methods:
a) git clone https://github.com/jcdutton/libbeauty.git
   $ cd libbeauty/libbeauty
b) https://github.com/jcdutton/libbeauty/archive/master.zip
   Extract the package and cd to the libbeauty source directory
   $ unzip libbeauty-master.zip
   $ cd libbeauty-master/libbeauty

6. Set CC, CXX, CPP, CXXCPP environment variables if you wish to use clang/llvm to compile libbeauty:
export CC=/usr/bin/clang
export CPP=/usr/bin/clang++
export CXXCPP="/usr/bin/clang++ -E"
export CPP="/usr/bin/clang -E"

Otherwise gcc is the default.

Then run once:
 $ autogen.sh
After that, you only need to run:
 $ ./configure

7. To compile, run
   $ make
8. To install, run
   $ make install

After a clean compilation and install, the libraries should be located at:
   /usr/local/lib/beauty/

9. Testing.
   $ cd test

First run "./test_case".
This should output:
NumOperands = 0x0, Offset = 0x3, Size = 0x1
Test passed

If it does not say test passed, libbeauty will not work.
To fix the test, you need to apply the "fix-wrong-displacementSize.diff"
to the llvm source (not the libbeauty source) and compile and install llvm again.
The test "./test_case" should now pass.

Next run "./test_id"
It should report:
ALL TESTS PASSED!

You can now try out libbeauty.
e.g.
./dis64 test0.o

dis64 is in the ./test directory.
The test0.o is in the ./src/test directory, along with many other tests, along with associated C code.
The will create .dot files in the ./test/cfg directory that look a bit like C code with comments.

dis64 is a currently a work in progress demonstration of the libbeauty library. It takes a .o file, and uses libbeauty to process it.

Soon, LLVM IR files will also be created, but that is work in progress right now, so the output to LLVM IR has been disabled for now.
